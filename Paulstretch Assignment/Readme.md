I feel like it was a slosh of noise.

The x100 seems similar just longer, which now that I think about it actually makes great sense.

You were correct in the sample questions, as now my question very much is how do I get cleaner results. I see that we are now using new things such as spear to do so. I also would like to apologize for the late arrival of this work. I joined in when I saw an opening, and then fell quite ill, which is still no excuse, but I promise I am a very dedicated working student and want to give work to impress! Thank you for you asisstance thus far and I promise to be on top of my work here on in!
